Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms using MATLAB. The algorithms included in this repository are:

1. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by finding the k nearest data points in the training dataset to a given test point and making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these neighbors.

Key Features:
Easy to understand and implement.
Non-parametric, making no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
Effective for smaller datasets.
2. Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

Key Features:
Simple to implement and interpret.
Provides insight into the relationships between variables.
Useful for predicting continuous outcomes.
