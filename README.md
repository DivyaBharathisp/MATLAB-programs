Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms using MATLAB. The algorithms included in this repository are:

1. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by finding the k nearest data points in the training dataset to a given test point and making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these neighbors.

Key Features:
Easy to understand and implement.
Non-parametric, making no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
Effective for smaller datasets.
2. Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

Key Features:
Simple to implement and interpret.
Provides insight into the relationships between variables.
Useful for predicting continuous outcomes.

Single-Neuron Neural Networks
This section contains implementations of basic single-neuron neural networks, including various activation functions. A single-neuron neural network mimics the behavior of a biological neuron, processing inputs and generating an output based on the weights and bias applied to the inputs.

Activation Functions:
Sigmoid: A smooth and differentiable function that maps input values to a range between 0 and 1.
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. Commonly used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Similar to the sigmoid function but outputs values in the range of -1 to 1.
Key Features:
Demonstrates the basic principles of neural networks.
Allows experimentation with different activation functions and their effects on output.
Provides insight into how single neurons can learn from data points.
